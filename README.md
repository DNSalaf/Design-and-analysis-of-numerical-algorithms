# Comparison of solutions and computational effort in solving pentadiagonal linear systems

This project aims to develop and compare some of the most popular techniques used in numerical systems for solving linear equations. The following are here explored:
- the Gauss elimination method
- the iterative Gauss-Seidel method

## Meta

## Documentation
Since this repository is a result from a Brazilian undergraduate course project focused in numerical algorithms developed in 2018, all the produced documentation are in Portuguese, as well as the provided assignment. Those document can be found in the docs folder.

## Compilation and Usage
By typing **make** in a terminal in the project directory, you can compile the project. Then, use the command **make run** to execute the programme.

Here is an example of usage, basically one needs to provide the input parameters in order to start the comparison process. A possible set of entries:
- n: 20
- dA: 2
- dB 1
- DP: 2.2
- dC: 0.1
- dD: 0.2
